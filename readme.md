# NBA Website

-This is site I'm creating to display live NBA game scores. More features are to be added in the future 

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you locally spin up the react front end and Flask backend API 

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (https://nodejs.org/)
- Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Flask (pip install Flask)

### Installing

- Follow these steps to set up the backend API, then the front end react UI. When you run each resource the commands should provide you the localhost link to see the pages, usually configured on ports 3000 and 5000 respectively

#### Setting up the Backend (Flask)

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

- ```git clone https://github.com/nickrinaldi88/nba-app.git```

2. Navigate to the Flask app directory:

- ```cd api```

3. Create a virtual environment:

- ```python3 -m venv venv```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
  ```
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS and Linux:
  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

5. Install the required Python packages:

-pip install -r requirements.txt

6. Start the Flask server:

-python3 app.py
